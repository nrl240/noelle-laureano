        <h4>
          After developing major dashboards in the finance industry for several years, the urge to switch contexts and dive further into tech grew too strong to ignore.
        </h4>
        <h4>
          In January 2018, I left the security and stability I had always known to focus solely on honing and growing my programming skills.
        </h4>
        <h4>
          My passion for developing is unmatched. Every day I wake up pumped to collaborate, design and code. I love every aspect of bringing an idea to fruition and find each step of the way exciting.
